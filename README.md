# Space Shooter with Pygame

Welcome to our Space Shooter project developed using the Pygame library! Immerse yourself in a cozy gaming experience that combines aesthetic visuals, soothing music, and charming artwork.

In the game we developed, the user controls the spaceship with the right, left, up, and down keys. As the player destroys the aliens that appear on the screen at regular intervals, they earn points. If the aliens' fire hits the player, the player's health is reduced by one, and the screen theme changes. The game ends when any alien reaches the bottom of the window or when the user's health reaches 0, resulting in victory for the aliens. Conversely, the player wins if they manage to eliminate all the aliens. The game score is calculated based on specific variables.

## Features

- **Player Controls**: Use the w-a-s-d keys to navigate your spaceship - right, left, up, and down.
- **Shooting**: Press the "space" key to fire projectiles at the incoming aliens.
- **Scoring System**: Earn points for each alien you destroy. The longer you survive, the higher your score.
- **Health Managements**: Be cautious! Alien projectiles reduce your health. Monitor your health bar closely.
- **Engaging Gameplay**: Immerse yourself in a cozy and addictive gaming experience with charming visuals and relaxing music.
